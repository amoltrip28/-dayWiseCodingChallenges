## 📢 Daily Updates

### Day 49 Update:
Today I tackled two key concepts crucial for interviews:

- 🔄 **Number Theory:** [Count Primes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/) — Implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently count all prime numbers less than n, marking non-primes and incrementing the count accordingly.
- 🌳 **Bit Manipulation** [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/) —  Leveraged XOR properties to identify the unique element that appears only once while all others appear twice, achieving linear time and constant space complexity.

Every challenge is making my fundamentals stronger. Huge thanks to Shriram R sir and the Placement Team for designing this impactful learning journey. Let’s keep climbing! 🚀
