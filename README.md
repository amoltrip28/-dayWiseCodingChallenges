## 📢 Daily Updates

### Day 31 Update:
Today was all about patterns and prime intuition:  
- 🧩 **DSA:** Next Greater Element I — mastering stack-based monotonic patterns  
- 🔢 **Math:** Count Primes — implemented the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes for optimized performance

The journey continues — with every new problem, the mindset and muscle for problem-solving grows stronger. 🚀  
Appreciation as always to Shriram R sir and the Placement Team for designing this life-changing initiative.

### Day 32 Update:
Today I tackled two key concepts crucial for interviews:

- 🔄 **DSA:** [Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/) — Applied matrix transformation logic using transpose and reverse techniques.  
- 🌳 **Math/DSA:** [Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/) — Practiced BFS traversal using queues.

Every challenge is making my fundamentals stronger. Huge thanks to Shriram R sir and the Placement Team for designing this impactful learning journey. Let’s keep climbing! 🚀
